0 ! Have lost particles on boundary re-injected uniformly (0 = no, 1 = yes)
0 ! Have particles reflected on Neuman-boundary refluxed with initial temperature
0 5.6d24 ! Have sonic injection at boundary + refluxing. If 1 first number, then second number is amount m^-2 s^-1, and third is amount macroparticles per injection (after time step completed)
0 3.d20 ! Have maxwellian injection uniformly in volume. If 1 first number, then second number is amount m^-2 s^-1
0 200.0d0 ! Have maxwellian heating uniformly among particles. If 1 first number, then second number is fraction of originally calculated del_t
13.56d6 220 0.01675 0.05025 ! EField RF field in y. First number RF frequency, second is total current density peak, then left and right x values for heating region. If RF = 0, then not applied

0 ! Have lost particles on boundary re-injected uniformly (0 = no, 1 = yes)
0 ! Have particles reflected on Neuman-boundary refluxed with initial temperature
0 5.6d24 ! Have sonic injection at boundary + refluxing. If 1 first number, then second number is amount m^-2 s^-1
0 3.d20 ! Have maxwellian injection uniformly in volume. If 1 first number, then second number is amount m^-2 s^-1
0 100.0d0 ! Have maxwellian heating uniformly among particles. If 1 first number, then second number is fraction of originally calculated del_t

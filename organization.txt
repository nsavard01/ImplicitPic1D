Should organize using modern OOP capabilities, cleaner code

Array Procedures (diff, integration, etc)

Constants (maybe just global in main?)

procedures producing intial conditions 

Charged Particle (object):
    - array of initial logical position
    - array of initial velocity
    - array (or single real) of weights? Maybe use single scalar for moment
    - single real of mass
    - single real of charge
    - do

Domain (Object):
    - array logical grid
    - array map each logical 'cell' to spatial cell
    - since scalar potential is tied to the grid, should it be contained in domain?
    - what about current density?

Potential (Object):
    - array of potential values, with fixed values for dirichlet
    - use domain to form matrix
    - store matrix for solver
    - methods for EField interpolation?

Particle Mover (procedure):
    - pass list of particles (or method contained in particle?)
    - substepping procedure
    - pass current density for substepping 

Solver (Object):
    - contains list particles objects
    - contains particle mover function
    - contains potential object
    - contains current density array
    - contains rho array
    - method for moving single time step
    - methods for adaptive time step

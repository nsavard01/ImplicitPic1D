1 ! Have lost particles on boundary re-injected uniformly (0 = no, 1 = yes)
1 ! Have particles reflected on Neuman-boundary refluxed with initial temperature
1, 5.6d24, 5 ! Have sonic injection at boundary. If 1 first number, then second number is amount m^-2 s^-1, and third is amount macroparticles per injection (after time step completed)
